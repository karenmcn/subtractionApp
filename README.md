Cute Kitten Subtraction: Built with a kitten loving little girl in mind to put a little fun into her multi-digit subtraction practice. When my daughter needed to practice her multi-digit subtraction, I knew I had the tools to build her a simple app that could make the whole process a little more fun for her.  I used some of the JavaScript built in Math functions, along with some jQuery and CSS to build a fun little app for my little girl. As a teacher,  I love the idea of building apps that can improve the educational experience of both teachers and learners.
